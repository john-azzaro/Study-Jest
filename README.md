# What is Jest?

**Jest is a JavaScript testing platform built by Facebook.** Although the Jest library is well suited for the React library, it is not limited to that and can test any JavaScript code.

# What is testing?

## Testing ensures that something is working.
Testing is a way we know that something is safe and working as intended. Components need to be tested as well. Tests are a routine that runs the subject under test (i.e. the testing code) and determines if the code tested conforms to expectations. You want to include tests in all of your projects because it serves as documentation that illustrates the way code should be used and provides a quick way to check if any new features that have been added break your existing code (i.e. regression).

## Testing individual components is called a "unit" test.
When we perform a unit test, we test small, isolated peices of code. Although Unit testing can be useful for testing functions or block of code, but doesnt really have any networking or database operations. Tests that involve components are usually done in isolation so that you know that each component is working as expected. 

## Testing components together is called an "integration" test.
When two or more units are combined, they form an interface, and when two or more interfaces are combined they form a component. When we want to test whether or not there are any bugs in those components when they are put together that we need to perfom an integration test. An integration test determines if independently developed units work correctly when they are connected to one another. Integration tests also help identify problems that occur at the interface level. Additionally, integration tests also ensures that the functional, performance, and reliability between units are integrated and working properly.
