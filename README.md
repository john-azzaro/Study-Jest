**Jest is a JavaScript testing platform built by Facebook.** Although the Jest library is well suited for the React library, it is not limited to that and can test any JavaScript code.

# What is testing?

## Testing ensures that something is working.
Testing is a way we know that something is safe and working as intended. Components need to be tested as well. Tests are a routine that runs the subject under test (i.e. the testing code) and determines if the code tested conforms to expectations. You want to include tests in all of your projects because it serves as documentation that illustrates the way code should be used and provides a quick way to check if any new features that have been added break your existing code (i.e. regression).

## Testing individual components is called a "unit" test.
Tests that involve components are usually done in isolation so that you know that each component is working as expected. For example, a unit test would involve testing a stand-alone component like a highlight feature. 

## Testing multiple components working together is called an "integration" test.
